### SDDM

### KDE-Plasma / KWin

## Troubleshootings

### Audio

- removing pipewire with Rncs also removes plasma(-meta)

- "sof-firmware" was missing first -> no soundcard & no audio devices

### SDDM

- if only sddm is installed (no DE), hitting enter on login wont do anything, because nothing is there
